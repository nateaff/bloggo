I am interested in math, algorithms, and creating things with data. I have a good deal of experience using R for statistical and predictive modeling but I plan on exploring other languages and tools in later blog posts.  

I recently finished my masters degree in mathematics and am looking for a data science adjacent role in the Bay Area.
